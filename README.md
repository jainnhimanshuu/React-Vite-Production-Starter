# React + Vite Production-Ready Template

This template provides a robust setup for building React applications using Vite, with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint integration. It includes utility classes and helpers to accelerate development and maintain code quality in a production environment.

## Features

- Fast development with Vite and React
- Hot Module Replacement for instant feedback
- ESLint integration for code consistency
- Utility classes for common operations
- URL management and API integration
- String manipulation and encoding utilities
- Browser detection and URL parameter handling

## Architecture

- Based on container and layout architecture
  - Container components handle data fetching, state management, and business logic
  - Layout components focus on UI presentation and structure
- Modular structure for easy maintenance and scalability
- Separation of concerns with dedicated providers and helpers
- URL management abstraction for API integration
- Utility-first approach with reusable helper classes
- Browser-compatible with checks for environment and device types
- Emphasis on type safety and error handling in utility functions
- Flexible URL parameter handling for dynamic routing and state management
